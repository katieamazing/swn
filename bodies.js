Leadership is highly distributed and slow to act. Despite having spread to another planet, there is almost no communication between the planets of Rye and Wheat. The planet has a small number of in-system space ships that are almost all owned by pirates who feel that piracy is in keeping with self-sufficiency. There exists a contrarian faction in the Precious Element group, which believes that Rye should quit piracy, join the sector economy, and sell its considerable mineral resources on the open market."

The majority at this point are'mustelid' variants, that is, inspired by artistic depictions of anthropomorphic skunks, but there are substantial minorities of vaguely chipmunk-ish, badger-ish, and fox-ish variants. The genetic engineering added some sophisticated three-way interconnections between the hippocampus, the vomeronasal organ, and the limbic system, which probably is why the locals survived the bioengineered plague which also occurred around the time of the Scream. One Cochene can develop an immune response, and communicate it via scent to everyone nearby, causing herd-immunity to outrun the infection. On the other hand, this also binds together essentially all Cochene, causing them to essentially never travel, and they react to people and scents as a bloc. If any Cochene likes you and/or the way you smell, soon essentially all Cochene likes you and/or the way you smell. If you piss off one Cochene, leading them to associate negative emotions with your smell, essentially all of Cochene will soon hate you and/or the way you smell."
