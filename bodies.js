Leadership is highly distributed and slow to act. Despite having spread to another planet, there is almost no communication between the planets of Rye and Wheat. The planet has a small number of in-system space ships that are almost all owned by pirates who feel that piracy is in keeping with self-sufficiency. There exists a contrarian faction in the Precious Element group, which believes that Rye should quit piracy, join the sector economy, and sell its considerable mineral resources on the open market."
